[fan]
; °C at which the linear ramp starts / ends
lv0 = 35          ; fan off-to-slow threshold
lv1 = 40
lv2 = 45
lv3 = 50          ; full-speed threshold
hysteresis = 2    ; °C band where fan speed is held
average_samples = 5
dc_min = 0.999    ; duty-cycle when “off” (0 = full, 1 = stop after inversion)

[temperature]
; Which sensor(s) drive the fan logic:
;   cpu     – only SoC temperature
;   drives  – max temp of all HDD/SSD in the HAT
;   both    – higher of CPU and drives
source = both
